# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bugs and Solutions

This repository contains examples of uncommon bugs encountered when using Tailwind CSS, along with their solutions. These bugs go beyond typical configuration issues and delve into more subtle problems related to CSS specificity, purging, and interactions with other libraries.

## Bugs

* **Bug 1: Unexpected Class Behavior Due to CSS Specificity Conflicts** -  This occurs when more specific CSS rules override your Tailwind classes.  Example: conflicting styles from a theme, a plugin or a component library.
* **Bug 2: Improper Purging** -  This leads to unused CSS being included in your production build, increasing file size and potentially causing conflicts. Often caused by incorrect configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.
* **Bug 3: Interactions with Other CSS Frameworks or Libraries** - Combining Tailwind with other CSS frameworks or libraries can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.  Example: Conflicts with Bootstrap or Materialize styles.

## Solutions

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates solutions for the described bugs using various techniques, including:

* **Overriding CSS specificity** using `!important` (as a last resort) or creating more specific selectors.
* **Properly configuring purging** in your `tailwind.config.js` to remove unused CSS.
* **Using CSS modules** or other techniques to isolate styles and prevent conflicts when working with other libraries.
